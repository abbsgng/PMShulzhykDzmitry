Descriptive statistical analysis as the name suggests helps in describing the data.
It gets the summary of data in a way that meaningful information can be interpreted from it.
Using descriptive analysis, we do not get to a conclusion however we get to know what in the data is i.e. we get to know the quantitative description of the data.

For instance, consider a simple example in which you must determine how well the student performed throughout the semester by calculating the average.
This average is nothing but the sum of the score in all the subjects in the semester by the total number of subjects.
This single number is describing the general performance of the student across a potentially wide range of subject experiences.

Whenever we try to describe a large set of observations with a single value, we run into the risk of either distorting the original data or losing any important information.
The student average won’t determine the strong subject of the student.
It won’t tell you the specialty of the student or you won’t come to know which subject was easy or strong.
 In spite of these limitations, Descriptive statistics can provide a powerful summary which may be helpful in comparisons across the various unit.
